Since the <a title="CNN article" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-05/tech/silicon.valley.job.market_1_software-engineers-job-market-simplyhired">CNN article</a>, I am no longer making my resume available. I do not wish to be contacted about joining any company or venture.

As of this post, I have been co-founding my own startup for over a year [1]. As CTO, I lead development (and sysadmin/QA work) on the Predictive Edge backend. Startup life keeps me busy.

I will graduate Stanford in a week. My degree is in Computer Science, with Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi Honors. Recently, I was named one of Stanford's <a title="top five" href="http://thephenomlist.com/pages/marty-hu">top five</a> graduates in Computer Science. However, I am dropping out of the the Stanford M.S program to work on my startup.

Besides the startup, I (sometimes) do other things in my spare time [2].

<a title="Predictive Edge" href="http://www.predictiveedge.com">Predictive Edge</a> is a pricing solution for online retailers. One way to understand what we do is to think of Amazon. A lot of Amazon's profit is derived from its ability to intelligently price its products. The prices of a majority of its products change just about every day. An item's price may change even while the item is in your shopping cart.

Now, the technology involved in predicting an optimal price is very sophisticated. Amazon can do it because it has a dedicated R&amp;D group. But we have found that most retailers could not afford the time or money to develop such an algorithm. What we do is offer this technology as a service. Using our technology, other online retailers can price like Amazon, <em>without the hassle</em>.

We are currently testing with forward-thinking online retailers on behalf of our private beta program. Here is the <a title="contact" href="mailto:info@predictiveedge.com">contact</a> email for retailers.

We are hiring! Here is our <a title="hiring blurb" href="http://www.martyhu.com/blog/hiring-blurb">hiring blurb</a>.

I enjoy programming. I got my first real programming job when I was 16, at Lockheed Martin's Solar Astrophysics Laboratory in Palo Alto. While I was there, I designed and implemented software to analyze raw image data gathered by the Solar B satellite. During this time, based on knowledge gleaned from a linear algebra class I was taking at Stanford, I was able to write software that is now in use by astrophysics labs worldwide.

Between then and now, I worked at RedWhale Software (where I co-authored a paper for the ACM IUI conference), and at Cisco Systems in the distributed systems group (where my code was shipped as part of the ANM 3.0 release). I am now very interested in engineering large scale production systems and love (systems-level) hacking enough to do it in my spare time. But I'm not a traditional raw hacker, in that I am also very interested in mathematics and algorithms. I think that when it comes to Computer Science, I still have a lot to learn.

I enjoy most sports, in particular: racket sports (tennis, badminton, table tennis), basketball, biking, running, and swimming. I can always handle good food. I am an Eagle Scout and Section Leader for Stanford's CS198 program, both organizations of which I am proud to represent. So I love the outdoors and teaching people what I've learned.
