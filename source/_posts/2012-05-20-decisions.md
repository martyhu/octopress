When I go about making decisions, I follow two simple rules:
<ol>
	<li>When I don't know what I'm doing, I listen very carefully to others and calibrate my decision based on their advice.</li>
	<li>If I really do know what I'm doing, I trust my own intuition and won't make a decision until I instinctively feel that it's the right one. [1]</li>
</ol>
I think this way because of my history in making decisions. Some of the worst decisions I've made came about when I "outsourced" decisions that I should have been making myself. In contrast, some of my best decisions were the ones that I made independently.

<em>Cisco Systems</em>
<ul>
	<li>At the time, I knew that I really wanted to work at a small company or start-up. But I wanted to keep my options open, so took an interview with Cisco anyway. Before I'd even interviewed with any other tech companies, they'd already given me an internship offer. (damn, that was fast!)</li>
	<li>My parents urged me to take the internship. They went on and on about how awesome like a company Cisco used to be and how so many millionaires had been made from it's stock catapulting up the NASDAQ. In light of what I felt was real wisdom, I purposely ignored my personal desire to work at a small-company.</li>
	<li>I was too sold (also, too stupid) to even try and get competing offers from other companies. I took the job. [2]</li>
</ul>
<em>Studying abroad in Beijing</em>
<ul>
	<li>Although I had never brought it up with them, I knew that my parents would be vehemently against it. During my last three years that I'd been at Stanford, they'd been dropping distasteful comments about how studying abroad was the best way to waste tuition money to learn nothing at all.</li>
	<li>Knowing this, I surreptitiously applied for the Stanford in Beijing program and was accepted. I then proceeded to sign all of the confirmation material indicating that I wanted to go. Then, I showed up at my parent's house with the "Preparing for Beijing" package in hand, and explained to them that I was all-in for this program. They could stop me if they wanted to, but I'd have to let such and such persons know as well as tell my future roommate that I'd no longer be living with him.</li>
	<li>To this day, my parents will still bring up how great of a learning experience their son had in China at dinner parties. How lucky their son is, to have parents who always know what's best for him! When this happens I'll smile and give them the credit. And chuckle to myself :P.</li>
</ul>
[1] At our company we have a team of trusted advisers that we consult with in regard to business and marketing strategy. Simultaneously, we develop all of our technology in-house and trust our own intuitions with regard to everything technology related.

[2] Cisco is still a very solid company, one that I personally believe will be around for the long term (the internet isn't going anywhere). However, the internship ended up being a bad fit for me as I spent my entire time there wanting to move fast and break rules, but not being able to.
