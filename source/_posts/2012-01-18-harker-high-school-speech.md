I was recently invited to give a speech about entrepreneurship at Harker High School as part of the Speaker's Bureau program. Here's a transcript of the speech I gave [1]:

<em>Transcript
</em>

I'm very thankful to be here today. Thank you, Sarina and Joe, for organizing this speaker series and for inviting me. It's so great to see all of your shining young faces excited about entrepreneurship. I have no doubt that many of you are already entrepreneurs.

Today, I am not going to tell you what entrepreneurship is like. I'm not going to tell you why you should do it, or give you any sort of specific advice on how to run and grow a company. If you want to learn about that, go read the interwebs. What I'd like to do instead is to give the speech that I would have wanted to hear as a high school student. I'm going to talk about what my life was like when I was your age in high school, and to tell you how that influenced me into eventually becoming an entrepreneur.

I've always believed that entrepreneurship is a lifestyle. It is, in my opinion, trying to do what no one, not even necessarily your own self, believes that you are able to do. It's about saying to yourself   forget it, I don't care, and I am going to do it anyway. I am not sure if I can actually do it, but there's one way to find out. Today, I am going to share with you two personally embarrassing stories from my life when I was your age where I tried to do something that I didn't know that I could do and went for it anyway.

Sometime when I was in seventh grade, I decided that I wanted to be president [2]. I didn't have any particular notions about whether or not I'd have anything close to a realistic chance in becoming the president. In fact, I was probably one of the most unpopular (not to mention reaaaal nerdy) kids in the school. But somehow in my mind, I had decided that I wanted to be president.

The way that elections work in middle school is that there is a week or so of campaigning, and at the end of that week you make a public speech in front of the entire school.

Anyway, for election week I had carefully devised a slogan. The slogan was "Join the Party, Vote for Marty". During election week, I would walk around with a party hat and ask people "Are you joining the party?" or tell them "It's not a party, without Marty". And they'd reply with something like, "Marty, of course I'm joining the party" or you know, something like that. I would say that election week went pretty well.

After election week, I was supposed to speak in front of the entire school. You know, in the front   the sixth graders, behind them   the seventh graders, all the way up to the eighth graders and teachers standing on the side of the auditorium judging me. But it was OK, because I had prepared a speech beforehand and all I would have to do is read off of it. In these speeches, generally how they go is that the speaker talks about how they have so-and-so experience with the student government (I didn't have any), and how they'd have so-and-so many ideas for what they'd do as President (I didn't really have any). So my speech, while having mostly vacuous content, did have one thing going for it, which was a short knock knock joke at the end of the speech.

This is how it went. I'll need your cooperation for this:

Me: Knock Knock!

Audience: Who's there?

Me: Marty!

Audience: Marty   who?

Me: That's me! (You see, this works because my last name is Hu)

Anyway, come Election Day, about to deliver the speech, I was definitely bat-shit nervous. I remember walking up to the podium and visibly trembling. I was so nervous that when I went up there to read off my speech, I totally messed up the knock-knock joke.

This is what I said. Again, I'll need your cooperation for this:

Me: Knock Knock!

Audience: Who's there?

Me: Marty Hu! (uhhh  derp?)

At this point, the entire auditorium goes silent. No one is laughing   everyone is just kind of staring up at me awkwardly. I'm sort of standing there awkwardly, knowing that I had totally butchered that one and not really knowing what to do next. Then the audience just starts clapping. I just look at them and quietly bow off the stage, generally embarrassed for myself. My speech was definitely over.

You're probably wondering if I won the election of not. I'll tell you straight up that I lost. But ultimately, I was fine with it and I was glad that I did it. Even though I didn't ultimately become President, it made a real difference for me.

<em>To be continued  </em>[3]

[1] This is a very rough transcript, because I did not use any notes or a slide deck when I gave the speech. I have tried to maintain the integrity of the content as much as possible, although the exact details will obviously be different. I've tried to write the post in more of my speaking voice (which is notoriously unedited) than my writing voice.

[2] To be exact, I mean eighth-grade president and not ASB president. The position I was actually running for was called "eighth-grade commissioner", where the commissioner ends up essentially being the president of that year.

[3] Actually, this transcript is looking like it's going to end up becoming a lot longer to write out than I originally thought that it would be (the speech itself was only about 10-15 mins). I'll finish the second story and wrap up in a later blog post, probably the next blog post.
