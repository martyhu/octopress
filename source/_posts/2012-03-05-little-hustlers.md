As I was passing by the Stanford Dish today, I noticed a young boy sitting in front selling refreshments from his cooler. He had parked himself at the front gate and had put up his own whiteboard, listing bottled water ($1 each), gatorade ($2 each), and various other drinks. The kid, who couldn't have been older than twelve, was sitting in the shade - wide grin on his face - wearing a Stanford hat and collecting donations from virtually everyone who passed by.

I thought to myself: damn, this kid is a real hustler. He'll make a great entrepreneur some day.

Today's event made me reflect a bit about my own experience as a young boy trying to make some money for myself. I grew up with parents that firmly believed that my life was too easy. As a result, they made it their duty to add artificial difficulty to everything that I did. Most notably, I never received any sort of allowance. If I ever wanted any money, I'd have to ask for it. And they'd usually *chuckle* for a bit then reply with a firm no. If they ever did say yes, I'd have to earn the money by doing everything that I didn't want to do: folding laundry (or other household chores), practicing piano [1], or memorizing SAT vocabulary words.

I figured that I'd need to find some way to make some money for myself so I wouldn't be spending my adolescence living in a world of (essentially) asian-level discipline. So after much deliberation, I came up with a plan. I'd sell candy at my middle school. At the time, the cafeteria wasn't selling any candy due to some kind of health policy, so the "market opportunity" was pretty wide open. So, I borrowed some money and bought the 300 pack of licorice and the 150 pack of Sour Power belts from Costco.

At the time, I had signed up for the School Service elective [2] so I'd get to go to all of the classes in the morning. When I did, I'd fill my pockets with ziploc bags of licorice and sour belts and would peddle my wares to the students in each class. I charged 25 cents for each licorice (one dollar for five), and 50 cents for each sour belt (one dollar for three). Interestingly enough, I made most of my sales in the Physical Education class. There, I'd sell to the students before (or after) they'd suited up. I still can't understand why anyone would buy candy right before going out to run the mile, but they did. In the first week or so, I'd already recouped on my initial investment.

Well, I was fairly indiscreet about my methods and good things can't really last forever. Soon enough, there were other students selling candy at such a reduced cost compared to me that I should have been driven out of business. But I'd still continue to sell without reducing prices due to my additional exposure (from that student service class) and the fact that I'd often spend the first half of lunch period selling candy rather than hanging out with my friends / eating my food (but making no money). Anyway, the school eventually instituted a ban on candy sales. Fortunately for me, I'd already made more than enough money for a middle schooler and certainly enough that I wouldn't have to barter with my parents. +1.

[1] Real - I did not like piano at all so this was pretty agonizing for me. I think a lot of the reason for this was that my experience with piano was filled with constant embarrassment. There'd be the embarrassment at home for sounding bad because I wouldn't practice, further embarrassment at my piano lesson for neglecting to practice, and <em>epic</em> embarrassment at the recital where all of the tiny whelps who had practiced hours on end would whoop me because I hadn't practiced. In fact, as soon as I made enough money for myself from the small candy "business", I quit piano. It's funny that years later I enjoy listening to others play piano (occasionally very good for coding, btw), but have never once regretted quitting piano or wish that I were able to play it myself.

[2] It still completely escapes me that I would have decided to sign up for this class in the first place. Essentially, the class was an unpaid job. The job responsibilities were as follows:
<ol>
	<li>At the beginning of the period, I would go and pick up all of the attendance sheets from every middle school teacher in the school. I would replace them with fresh attendance sheets, which were bubbled with tardy or absent students. (think scan tron)</li>
	<li>I would take all of the scan trons and log all of the tardy/absent students. (In retrospect, it's pretty lame that I should have had to do this at all because the task could have easily been accomplished with a computer)</li>
	<li>I'd take some candy (on the honor system so I'd never really get that much) as a reward.</li>
</ol>
By the way, it was the candy that got me thinking about selling candy in the first place. In case you didn't guess already.
