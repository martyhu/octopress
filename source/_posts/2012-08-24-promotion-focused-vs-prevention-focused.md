One book I recently read and enjoyed immensely is <em>Succeed: How We Can Reach Our Goals</em> [1]. The chapter that stuck out to me as particularly interesting is the author's discussion of the difference between pursuing goals with a promotion vs. prevention focus.

An easy way to understand the difference between these two goals is tocontrast the parenting styles that are correlated with a promotion vs.prevention focus:

* In a promotion-focused family, the student who performs well is showered with praise, taken out for dinner, etc. However, when the student does not perform well, nothing happens. Someone who is promotion-focused is generally very accomplishment-oriented and is willing to risk failure in order to not miss out on a possible best outcome.

* By contrast, the student in a prevention-focused family does not receive any reward for performing well. However, if the student under performs, his/her parents will be quick to employ punishment. Someone raised with a prevention-focused background is generally very safety-oriented and prefers avoiding a bad situation to possible good outcome with high risk.

Of course, neither focus is necessarily better than the other [2]. However, knowing which focus you are can be very interesting for self-introspecting your other behaviors:

In my own experience, the promotion-focus vs. prevention-focus theory has been ubiquitous for me since I read the chapter. I am definitely very prevention-focused (at least) in my approach towards problem solving. I would characterize myself as a very slow thinker: rather than relying chiefly on my intuition, I typically solve problems and arrive at decisions in a methodical and meticulous fashion. While I consider myself generally unlikely to stumble upon a stroke of genius, I can execute relatively well and generally avoid costly mistakes.

Thinking back, my thought process used to serve me well in my former days as a chess player. Rather than pursuing a quick, decisive victory, I learned to play a very positional game, memorizing and learning the most boring openings in the game as my repertoire [3]. Over two hours of gameplay (club is G60, so each player gets 60 minutes), I would patiently make less-than-astounding moves and watch carefully for a play error on behalf of my opponent. I was and am by no means a very good chess player - I would have been somewhere around 1400 ELO at the time - but I could occasionally pull off unexpected victories against players whose play ability much exceeded my level. I once beat an 1860 ELO player (who now plays on the Stanford Chess team) this way.

I realize that my software programming mentality is also somewhat prevention-focused. Rather than staring at the computer screen and in a flash of insight brazenly hacking out a compelling algorithm, I am very detail-oriented and meticulous in the way that I write code. My style is to slowly, methodically add piece by piece of code to my program until I have something that's workable. It's no coincidencethat I decided to focus in Systems Programming - when I was in college, my favorite classes were the ones in which we wrote C [4].

As you pursue your own future goals (with great success!) I'd encourage you to think about your own mindset and possible circumstances in which you can take advantage of your own natural abilities.Whether or not you're promotion-focused, prevention-focused, fast-thinking, or slow-thinking, it may prove to be useful to you :P.

[1] The <a title="book" href="http://www.amazon.com/Succeed-How-Can-Reach-Goals/dp/1594630739">book</a>, written by Heidi Grant Halvorson, studies success from a goal-oriented perspective. In particular, she writes about how you can dramatically impact goal completion by changing your mindset for howto approach your goals. I'm definitely +1 for the book and would highly recommend it to the interested reader.

[2] In my own experience, I would definitely say that promotion-focused parenting is a very "American" way of raising a kid. In contrast, the majority of Asians that I know (high performers in school, no doubt), were raised with a prevention-focus. From anecdotal evidence, I know that the prevention-focused mentality can be very successful at least in academics.

[3] Back in the day, the chess player I strove to emulate was Anatoly Karpov, former world champion of pre-Kasparov chess. In fact, some ofthe most interesting matches in chess history are between Karpov (who could exert minimal advantage and defend boring positions ardently) and GarryKasparov (who aggressively invented new openings and excelled at strategic play).

[4] C is a notorious "weeder" language for beginners, since it is essentially just one step above machine code. When you write real C code, you are literally flipping the bytes yourself and managing your own memory. More so than in most modern programming languages, coding in C can be brutally difficult to debug due to this low-level nature.

When I was at Stanford, I never procrastinated much (a habit commonly found in prevention-focused students, who are afraid of not finishing their assignments). I found that I'd frequently finish assignments early - and that I'd often use the extra time to systematically weed out all of the bugs I could find in the programs that I wrote.

This habit saved my grade in at least one situation that I can think of. In my Computer Networking class, I actually bombed the final witha grade two standard deviations below the mean (ouch). However, the professor took pity on me and floated my grade up to an A- due to my perfect score on all of the programming assignments that I had submitted.

Even now, I find that I prefer to create hordes of test cases to proveto myself that something is correct. :P
