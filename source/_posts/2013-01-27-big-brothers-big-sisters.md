I've been asked about BBBS (Big Brothers Big Sisters) several times now and wanted to distill my experience into a FAQ in case it'd be useful to anyone. I started mentoring for the program over nine months ago and think that it has been one of the best personal decisions that I've made. Please note that I write about my experience and that yours will most likely very different.

If you're interested, check out their website at bbbsba.org for a FAQ about the application process. I'm also happy to field any questions.

<strong>How did you get started with Big Brothers?</strong>

My life ambition is to help others [1]. One day when I was thinking about it, I realized - what am I waiting for? If I am able to help others today, why wait? I decided that if that was what I wanted to do with my life, I should do it today.

I posted a note on Facebook later that day, and BBBS came up. As soon as I found out about it, I knew that I wanted to do it. I was looking for something very serious and long-term, as opposed to a slew of one-off events. I loved the flexibility and wanted to do something very hands-on. Most importantly, it felt like something that would really make a difference.

<strong>What is the time commitment like?</strong>

It differs for each match, but the program asks that you meet with your little 2-4 times a month. You can meet with your little as few or as many hours in each appointment as you like.

My schedule is closer to every other week. I usually meet with my little on Saturday at 11am and drop him back off anywhere from 2-3pm. If I have an important deadline, I may skip a weekend. Usually if I skip a weekend I will communicate in advance with his grandmother and plan to make up the time by scheduling a few weekends in a row. My little and his grandmother are okay with the flexibility of my weekends changing, so not all matches would necessarily work out this way.

Given that you may not have as much time as I do, I want to say that the amplification for your time is enormous. What may only be a few hours for you may affect an empowerment of many hours in another person.

<strong>What kinds of activities do you do?</strong>

We just do whatever we both feel like doing. Yesterday, we went to the YMCA to work out, and then hit up Three Brothers in East Palo Alto for Tacos. Another time, we went to IKEA for lunch, where there happened to be a caricature artist who made caricatures for us. One of his favorite outings was to the Palo Alto Junior Museum. My little is very social and absolutely loves pets. So one time we went over to Petco and spent the entire day petting dogs. Over the summer, we got set up with the summer reading program and would read books aloud in the library.

We always grab lunch together. Our top 2 places are the McDonalds by IKEA, and the Treehouse at Stanford. So we will often go hang out and do various activities at Stanford. When we go, I casually mention to him that if he does well academically, he might get to attend Stanford ;).

<strong>What is your little like?</strong>

I can't say too much about this here due to privacy concerns. However, I will say that my little is a nine year old and behaves exactly as you would expect from a nine year old. So while it is often very fun to hang out with him, I need to be very patient and perpetually "on my guard" to make sure that I don't let him get away with mischievous behavior.

For example, the first time we hung out I didn't know that anyone under 13 is required by law to sit in the back seat (the law additionally requires anyone under 8 to be in a car seat in the back, unless they are 4'9" or taller). We spent the entire day driving around with him in the front seat. It was only when we got back that his grandmother saw us and let me know about the law. I remember that he sheepishly admitted that he had known the entire time - he just loved sitting in the front and blasting music!

<strong>Why do you like it?</strong>

It is easy to overlook this as a Big, but the small amount of time you spend with your little makes a big impact for them. I know that in my experience I have never once tutored him in Math. However, since I have been working with him his academic performance (especially in Math) relative to grade level have increased precipitously based on both teacher evaluation and standardized test scores. It makes me feel like a very proud asian parent. I love it.

That said, I want to issue a warning not to try and revolutionize your little. Managing expectations is important (they will cover this in orientation). Personally, I understand that my little is a different person than me and hold him to different standards than I would myself. I do not intend to be his parent   - I simply intend to be someone who is supportive and believes in him.

<strong>What is the application process like?</strong>

There is a vetting and interview process. To subsidize the vetting process, you pay them a fee ($35) to apply. You will also have to gather something like four recommendations before your application is considered complete. Good people to ask for the recommendations are family members, life coaches, and your best friends.

I looked at my previous emails, and here is the rough timeline for how long it took for me. Please note that it differs for each Big what the process time is. For you it may be shorter or longer, depending on the Littles that are available and what they are looking for in terms of age, gender, interests, etc.
<ul>
	<li>Online application to response from a person - 4 days</li>
	<li>Follow up for scheduling in-person email - 5 days</li>
	<li>Contact from interviewer - 1 week</li>
	<li>Interview - 3 days</li>
	<li>Orientation - 2 weeks</li>
	<li>Meet little formally - 4 weeks</li>
</ul>
[1] I probably am very similar to the reader in this regard. I believe in the essential goodness of humanity and want to make a difference in the world.
