<em>Impossibility</em>

For the longest time, the four-minute mile was deemed physically impossible. The invisible barrier was so completely accepted that many doctors believed that running at such a speed would be fatal to the human body.

Then on May 6th 1954, medical student Roger Bannister shattered the record with a mile time of 3:59.4. Six weeks later, athlete John Landy broke the world record again with a time of 3:58.0.

Now that someone could run the four minute mile, everyone began to do it. Within the next few years, swathes of runners were breaking the four minute barrier. To this day, thousands of runners have run the sub-four minute mile. The four-minute mile is now the standard for nearly all professional mile runners. Even high school runners have broken it.

<em>Self-Concept</em>

When Roger Bannister set out to run a four-minute mile, everyone knew that what he was trying to achieve was impossible. He just ignored them and did it anyway. The man changed the face of running because he wouldn't let anyone else dictate who he was or what he could or couldn't do.

If you live your life trying to be the person whom others want you to be, you'll end up miserable and exhausted. Society has such ridiculous standards for everything that you'll never be satisfied: there will always be someone who is better looking, wealthier, or more famous than you are. Living for the eyes of others is a deprivation of what it means to be alive. Your own self-concept is vastly more important than what anyone else thinks about you.

I've always believed that the biggest limitation to our ability to change the world is inside of our own mind. This is because it is from the mind that we define and shape our own world. Everything - from our dreams and aspirations to whether or not we will admit defeat   is in our head. The tragedy of mankind is that there are so many of us who are really capable of changing the world, but stop shy due to lack of ambition.

No one ever did what they didn't believe they could do.
