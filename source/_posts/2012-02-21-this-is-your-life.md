Today, I had <a title="This is Your Life - Switchfoot" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWArhq3FUEY">this</a> Switchfoot song stuck in my head. The song is called "This is Your Life", and the relevant part of the lyrics are as follows:

> 	Yesterday is a kid in the corner
>	Yesterday is dead and over

>	This is your life, are you who you want to be
>	This is your life, are you who you want to be

Naively, the lyrics have a bit of an emo ring to them because they bring up yesterday several times. It's as if this is the song you'd listen to the day after you'd done something really stupid and embarrassing. The singer is telling you to wake up and get on with your life. Forget about yesterday. If you spend all of your time in yesterday, you won't be living for today.

<em>Are you who you want to be?</em>

Even though the song never mentions it explicitly, when I play back the lyrics in my head I feel that they also address the future. To me, the artist is challenging the listener. Are you who you want to be? Or rather, if you want to be person X in the future, are you being person X today? If not, what are you waiting for?

There's this guy that I learned about recently named Demitri Martin. He dropped out of law school in his final year to become a comedian. Since then, he's done <a title="a lot" href="http://www.demetri-martin.com/demetrimartin.html">a lot</a> of cool stuff. Well, he realized when he got to law school (full scholarship at NYU, btw) that he hated it. He'd pass by comedy clubs on his way to the law school and would think about trying it. So he dropped out. I'm sure he got deplored by his parents and many of his peers when he did it. But he did it anyway. And we can all get a good laugh because of it. [1]

Don't wait for tomorrow to be the person you could be today.

[1] I feel that in many respects, my experience with entrepreneurship is the same way. For me, my experience with entrepreneurship is just beginning. But being an entrepreneur is where I want to end up. That's what I want to do with my life. So much for life path.
