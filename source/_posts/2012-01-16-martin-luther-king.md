<em>Martin Luther King</em>

This past weekend, I picked up a copy of <em>Autobiography of Martin Luther King Jr.</em> on audio CD. The recording is a narrative pieced together from historian Clayborne Carson, who was given all of the private memoirs of the late Martin Luther King Jr. from his wife, Coretta Scott King. The tape is told in the first person, as if it were his autobiography.

For me, the content in the tape is some of the most compelling that I have ever heard. In honor of Martin Luther King Jr. day, I wanted to share some of it that I remember:
<ul>
	<li>Martin Luther King Jr. was first introduced to his future wife, singer Coretta Scott, through a mutual friend over the telephone. Over the phone, he very politely asked her for a first date. She agreed. During their first date, MLK told her that he was impressed that she could not only sing, but that she also had a good mind. He asked her to marry him. A year later, they were married.</li>
	<li>At one point of his life, MLK was working on his doctorate studies at Boston University and living in Boston. Since he was living in the North, he and his wife lived in a mostly segregation-free world. However, he had originally grown up in the South, and felt a sense of civic service to his brethren still living there. So he moved south to Montgomery, Alabama to become minister for Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.</li>
	<li>Over the course of his life, both MLK's house and church are bombed multiple times. In one particularly bad incident, his entire front porch is blown away. By the time MLK gets home, a mob of blacks has gathered outside, carrying weapons and threatening the police. He urges them to under no circumstance engage in violence, and to put down their weapons and head home. He succeeds. Everyone heads home.</li>
	<li>After the Supreme Court's verdict came out that Alabama's Montgomery Bus System was unconstitutional, the reactionary KKK announced that they were going on a raid, threatening to undermine the successes of the black social liberalization movement. Ordinarily when the KKK makes such threats, blacks hide in their homes and "play dead", turning off the lights to the house. However this time MLK persuaded everyone not to hide, but to instead turn on all of the lights in their houses and leave their doors open. As the KKK drove past, some blacks even waved at the hooded members. Ultimately, the KKK did not conduct any raid at all, but instead drove away, embarrassed.</li>
</ul>
I wish you a happy Martin Luther King Jr. day.
