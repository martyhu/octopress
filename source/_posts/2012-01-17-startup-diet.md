Everyone seems to think that because I'm starting a company, I do nothing but eat ramen all of the time [1]. Nothing could be further from the truth; in fact I haven't eaten ramen once since starting this company. I think it's just plain unhealthy and doesn't taste very good. If I had to eat ramen, that would be a real low point of my life.

Even without ramen, we still manage to be very scrappy when it comes to food:
<ul>
	<li>Our food budget is currently averaging $1 per person, per meal. We do this by cooking nearly every meal and by never going out to eat on company money. The dishes that we cook regularly include lettuce wraps (with ground beef and Yoshida's sauce), spaghetti (with ground beef, garlic, and onions), tacos (with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, beans, and rice) and fried rice (with ground beef, eggs, and broccoli). We get the ground beef that's two days to expiration from Safeway, because it's about half-price from the normal ground beef. It comes out to slightly less than $2 per pound.</li>
	<li>We eat a lot of rice and potatoes - our house has almost finished the 50-pound bag of rice that we bought from Costco earlier this summer. The bag of rice cost us less than $20 and feeds way more than it's fifty pounds worth of food.</li>
	<li>We eat <em>a lot</em> of eggs, and drink <em>a lot</em> of milk. The last time we went to Costco, we picked up 144 eggs and six gallons of milk for the six of us in the house. After barely over a week, all of the eggs were eaten, and all of the milk was gone. On a typical day, our fridge is literally completely filled with eggs and milk.</li>
	<li>We use the microwave all of the time. Generally, whenever I cook anything (e.g fried rice) I will cook around six to eight servings on top of what I'm going to eat. Then I'll tupperware the rest of the food, put it in the refrigerator, and eat the leftovers from it for the next couple of days.</li>
	<li>We buy lots of fruits and vegetables (they're by far and away the most expensive item that we buy foodwise) and stack them up in the fridge alongside all of our sausage, eggs, and milk. Most of the time, we eat vegetables raw. I like to take my vegetables (e.g celery, bell peppers, cucumber) and just put them by my computer to eat while I work.</li>
</ul>
The last time we ate out as a company at the beginning of this past summer, we went to IKEA and lined up for the $3.99 IKEA meatballs, with lingonberry jam, gravy and mashed potatoes. It turns out that at IKEA, you can pay $1 extra and get eight extra meatballs. None of us paid for the extra meatballs.

When we raise money, we'll be able to afford the extra $1 for the extra IKEA meatballs.

[1] This probably comes from the fact that startups in the dot-com bubble ate ramen all of the time. I speculate that they did so because they raised too much money and worked in offices, where you couldn't fit much inside other than a microwave and a shelf full of ramen. In that situation, if you didn't cook your food at home (you couldn't cook in the office, as we do) and you wanted to eat, you had better be eating ramen. So ramen profitability comes to mind when I think of the slightly-better-off than scrappy company, that has enough funding to have an office, but not enough to be profitable catering professional chefs who serve luxuries like steak and lobster for dinner.
