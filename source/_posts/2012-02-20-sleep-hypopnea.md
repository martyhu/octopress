<em>Sleep Hypopnea</em>

I got dinner with one of my good friends yesterday. A few months ago, he had joined a sleep study because he was getting very poor sleep in his graduate student life. So he figured that something must be up and planned to get it checked out. So he paid for a sleep study (these are in generally high demand; you pay them instead of them paying you) and got it checked out over winter break.

Well, the results from the sleep study just came back. As it turns out, that he has sleep hypopnea. It's a disorder that is in essence the same as sleep apnea, but instead of not being able to breathe, your oxygen flow is greatly reduced. The symptoms are that you'll be excessively sleepy (due to constant sleep interruption) and snore very loudly.

Of course, he's had sleep hypopnea his entire life. But he never realized that anything might be wrong because he would always take naps in the middle of the day and never be exposed to the symptoms (ie. excessive sleepiness). It was only this year that his life as a graduate student and continuous scheduled meetings throughout the day and prevented him from taking his usual afternoon nap. Suddenly, he realized that something might be up. Due to his recent change in lifestyle, he now has a better understanding of his own circumstance and can address it appropriately.

I can understand his story because it is strongly related to two recent experiences I had with my own health:

<em>Frog Eyes</em>

I used to consider myself somewhat of a "Super Asian" because my vision was 20/20. Or rather, I thought that it was. So I never wore glasses. I would read from my computer screen, play racket sports, and drive without them. I would even go to the doctor every year and get prescribed a pair of glasses (which I'd promptly forget about after the appointment).

Well, this past summer I was playing (3-set) tennis with a good friend of mine. I was having a particularly good game that day, and picked up the first set. However, we had scheduled a game during the afternoon so by the second set, twilight was starting to approach. Suddenly I stopped playing as well, losing the second set by a good margin. By the time we started playing the third set, it was already almost dark. I lost every single point that set, and wasn't even able to return my opponent's serve. Damn, I thought to myself - something must be wrong.

As it turns out, I had been prescribed to wear a set of glasses since the beginning of college but had been to stubborn to ever wear them. I had never noticed that I wasn't able to see the black board in lecture because I was always that obnoxious kid who sat in the front row and asked question after question. I had studied Computer Science in college, so I generally used my near-distance focusing muscles in front of my computer instead of gazing out into the stars.

So now I wear a pair of glasses. Every day.

<em>Hella Lactose</em>

Believe it or not, I used to be really short. I was in the 25th percentile for height, and if I did as if my doctor predicted I would have been 5'3". This might be a bit unexpected, since I am  5' 10-11" today.

I (perhaps mistakenly) attribute my growth spurt to a conscious decision to drink a lot of milk. When I was in middle school, I used to drink six glasses of milk a day. Our family would literally go to Costco every weekend and stock up on milk because my brother and I would consume so much.

Well, the other day I was getting lunch at Stanford and had a few glasses over there - a bit more than I usually have for lunch. But on this particular day, I felt suddenly bloated after lunch. My stomach felt awful. I was tired. I kept passing a lot of gas. I managed to drag myself home and had to take a nap for a few hours before I was ready to get back to everything.

I've had a lot of bloated stomach, stomach pains, and gas in the past, but never attributed them to any kind of lactose intolerance. It was always my mood, or the weather, or the fact that I didn't get good sleep the night before. But suddenly after ceasing to drink as much milk, I don't have stomach aches any more. It's just this realization that wow, this is how my life is supposed to be.

<em>Some Final Thoughts</em>

At the end of the day, we all have our quirks. Just because we don't see them doesn't mean that we don't exist. And it's damn hard to do something about something you don't know even exists.

A little bit of introspection can go a long way.
