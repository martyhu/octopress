My co-founders and I decided that we wanted to work together before we had any idea what we would work on. Years from when we started, we still work, live, and cook together. On weekends in the office, we troll each other continuously while we work. For celebratory team dinners, we pig out at <a title="Sushi Infinity" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-infinity-san-jose#hrid:CE9JnEe4ax8jEnzGZLEv9A">Sushi Infinity</a>. When we deployed our servers, one of the first things we did was to set up ASCII art that would greet each of us with a Magic the Gathering <a title="planeswalker" href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/multiverse/planeswalkers.aspx?x=mtg/multiverse/planeswalkers/ajani">planeswalker</a> when we logged in as our Message Of the Day.

I had never planned to start a company right out of college. That I did so is a testament to the extraordinary disposition of my co-founders. I did not want to miss the opportunity to work closely with such high-caliber people. As risky as a start-up is, I intuitively felt that I was not taking a risk at all. Talent reduces risk.

My belief in the critical importance of environment stems from my experience growing up. I admired my best friends in childhood and still admire them today. In many ways, they were my role models from a young age.

For where I came from, I consider myself of ordinary disposition. I scored <a title="relatively poorly" href="http://www.martyhu.com/blog/talent/">relatively poorly</a> on standardized tests at a young age went to an after school program to develop my math and verbal reasoning skills. I played sports year round (soccer, baseball, basketball, etc.) but was a rather wimpish kid and not very good at any of them.

My best friends in middle school became such because they were the other kids who were awkward socially and bad at sports. On Fridays, we'd all go to the after-school Math Club. Once there, we would drink grape soda, binge on Costco pizza, and try to impress the girls in the club with poorly executed math puns. During my eighth grade, we had a high-school math biker gang. Wheezing for breath, we'd often race what were probably the crummiest bikes at the school right up to our second period classrooms. After minutes of catching our breath, we would then leisurely saunter into our classes. We were the class clowns that teachers tolerated because we had the grades to make up for it.

In high school, we were in all the same activities together. We skipped grades in Math and Science together and took many of the same AP classes. One of my friends became the President of the Palo Alto High School "Hair on Fire" Math Club. Another served as Captain of the Science Olympiad and Key Club International. Two others became Eagle Scouts before me in my Boy Scout troop. Thankfully for me, I have never been the type to get jealous.

I believe that accomplishments often derive from character. I learned this from observing a habit of one of my friends:
> On weekends, we used to go to each other's houses to play Super Smash Brothers Melee. Most of the time, we ended up at the house of one particular friend. This friend was (and still is) a highly self-motivated person. His parents spent a lot of time doing business in China so he was home most of the time with just his nanny and younger sister.

> This friend had the largest television of any of us, along with four controllers to boot. He was easily the best Super Smash Brothers player in our group and in my opinion enjoyed the game more than anyone else.

> Despite his enthusiasm for the game, he would occasionally leave us in the midst of our gaming marathon to practice piano. He would promptly excuse himself, set a timer, and steadfastly practice his composition. Ignoring the piano, the rest of us would excitedly continue to game. Hours would pass. When it ultimately grew dark and we were leaving to bike home, he would often still be at the piano, practicing.

> Today, my friend is an outstanding piano player. He is also a PhD fellow in Astrophysics at MIT.

Neither of us has enough time to smash anymore. We've gone our separate ways and no longer share the same activities. But we continue to share a mutual respect.
