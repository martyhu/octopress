As our start-up continues to progress, I find myself working longer and longer hours [1].  I think the reason for this is due to our progress. We've now gotten to a point where there are a number of people who believe in us to the point of being personally invested in our success. It goes without saying that we would literally have no business whatsoever without these early believers. As much as I want the company to exit as a founder, I also want to personally make it happen all of those who have put their stake into our venture.

I wanted to bring this up because I spoken to a number of young people recently who are contemplating entrepreneurship for the first time. These are guys and gals who clearly understand the risk-reward pay-out and can afford to take a lot of risk at this point in their career. The general theme that I get is something like like, "If I do a startup, it'll either go big or go bust within 1-2 years, if it goes bust I'll just do another startup, and then if that one goes bust, I'll do another like it's nbd". The Silicon Valley sacred cow seems to be that you might as well do a start-up simply because it doesn't cost you very much. If you're 25 now and you'll need to settle down when you're 35 or so, that's five swings at bat to hit the home run... right?

I think this line of thinking is just hot-shot dogma, and actively disagree with it. Okay, I understand that you're a hot-shot [2]. But no one (not even Colonel Sanders) can build a company much bigger than a mom-and-pop fried chicken shop by themselves. At some point you (like Colonel Sanders) will have to depend on other people to build a scalable business. And if you run a company straight into the ground after a year, you're not being fair to the people who put their time, money and reputation at stake with you. If you continue to do this, pretty soon you'll have no believers. Good luck doing start-up #2, let along start-up #3.

I've always believed that one's reputation is absolutely crucial in this simple way. You had better be who you claim to be. And if you claim you'll do it, you had better do it.

[1] Before you get the wrong idea, I want to say that I am by no means god-like and do not work anything like 30 hours in one day (props to you banker kids who do that). I can't give any sort of estimate of how many hours I work, because I could care less about that number and don't optimize for it. However, I will say that I prefer to work every day, especially Saturday and Sunday. In fact, weekends are often (for me) some of the best days to get work done. When I was a student I worked weekends, just like everyone else. So to me, getting a bit ahead over the weekend seems more natural than artificially giving myself a break when I don't need one.

I've set up our production and staging servers so they have perhaps a hundred integration tests continuously running and if any single one of them fails to repeatedly send me text messages until I address the problem. So I could theoretically get woken up at any point in the night to fight fires and otherwise save the world.

[2] You wouldn't even be thinking about doing a start-up if you didn't think so. Start-ups are risky, but that's not how a typical start-up founder thinks. Instead, they think that by starting their own company, (as opposed to joining an established company) they're actually reducing risk. That's because the founders trust themselves to the extent that they see it as a greater risk to trust some knucklehead at another company.

By the way, this whole confidence bias reminds me of America, and our national obsession with self-confidence. Duly note that American students rank near the bottom in world rankings for both math and reading, yet rank a shining #1 in self-confidence. Contrast this with China (#1 in math and reading, btw), a nation where parents teach their kids that it's more important to be right rather than to be self-confident. I'd like to think that perhaps both nations could learn a bit from each other.
