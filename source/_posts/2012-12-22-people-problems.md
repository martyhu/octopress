Q: What is counter-intuitive about start-up life? What is the hardest part of starting your company?

A: People problems.

I've come to believe that entrepreneurship is hard because of neither long hours nor the lack of work-life balance. Yes, it is true that starting a company can mean long hours and trading off work-life balance [1]. However, these late nights are some of the best times that a start-up can have; it is during these moments you care about what you're working on so much that you are willing to pull the late night in the first place. On the contrary, during the toughest days of a start-up you mentally clock out early. That's when you're so defeated that mustering morale to power through the day seems overwhelming.

In observing all of the problems our start-up has ever had, consistently the most painful problems we've had to deal with thus far have been people problems. In fact, I've decided that no problem is truly life-threatening to a newborn company unless it is also a people problem. As long as morale is high and the team is unanimously on board, the start-up should be OK [2].

Several weeks ago, I attended a talk Steve Ballmer was giving for the <a title="StartX" href="http://startx.stanford.edu/">StartX</a> community [3]. Informally, everyone in the room came to hear about Windows 8 and Microsoft's strategic vision. But instead, Ballmer surprised everyone by focusing his content around Microsoft's developer culture. At Microsoft, Steve said, <em>everything</em> is ultimately a people problem. It is of utmost importance, he says, that employees like and respect each other because teams who do will communicate well and write much better code. He went on to recall with fondness his early days with Microsoft with Bill Gates, where hiring was essentially his full-time job.

Ballmer still spends much of his own time hiring. Some time ago, a friend of mine told me that when he received his internship offer at Microsoft, Steve called him and chatted with him for over an hour to try and persuade him to spend his summer working there.

This seemed counter-intuitive to me when I first heard it. How can it be that a Fortune 500 CEO has the time to spend phoning prospective interns? It must be, I thought, that Steve Ballmer had thoroughly jumped the shark on this one.

I revisited my assumption after learning that my friend had declined his other offers to spend the summer at Microsoft [4]. Now, I implicitly understand Ballmer was right about this one. People are more valuable by far than anything else in your company. Even something so abstract as software, when it ultimately comes down to it, is fundamentally a very human problem.

As a founder, you are probably a forward thinker and a do-er by nature. You are the kind of person who will want to take your vision of the future and immediately start sprinting toward it. However, a start-up, as in a marathon, is not a sprint from start to finish. Ultimately for most of us, running the marathon is not even about a time. In a marathon, if a runner collapses, you will see other runners stop to make sure he/she is okay. In this way, marathons are profoundly human. Everyone wants everyone else to finish. Everyone else wants you to finish.

Ultimately start-ups, like marathons, are about our humanity.

[1] Some people compare the intensity of starting a company to serving in the military. I think that is total bullshit. The men and women who serve their country are much braver than I am and I have tremendous respect for them. In my opinion, starting a company doesn't even come close to that in terms level of difficulty. As Steve Blank <a title="says" href="http://steveblank.com/2012/09/04/entrepreneurship-is-hard-but-you-cant-die/">says</a>, "entrepreneurship is hard but you can't die".

[2] Our company definitely exemplifies this behavior. The first summer we started work on this company, being scrappy was too much fun. We ate nothing but microwavable food: Marie Callender's Chicken Pot Pie, Chicken Bakes, Easy Mac, and Bagel Bites. I would regularly stay up past 2am (the rest of the team even later) and generally neglected to exercise. And loved it.

(By the way, I am not gratuitously scrappy now and don't think that entrepreneurs should have to be.)

[3] StartX is the best incubator out there right now. Exclusive to Stanford teams, it is highly unusual in that it takes 0% equity. Especially if you have not raised funding, StartX and its alumni network will help you, a lot.

I'm proud to be an alum. If you're considering an application, feel free to reach out and send me an email.

[4] My friend did not end up joining Microsoft full time, but has consistently delivered high praise for the company. He is now a start-up founder.
