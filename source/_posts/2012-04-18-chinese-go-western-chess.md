I've been recently listening to Henry Kissinger's <em>On China </em>on audio CD and I have to say that it's actually pretty excellent. In the first chapter, the author compares all of Chinese and Western strategy to the board games Go (Weiqi) and Chess. In a nutshell, his point is that Weiqi is game of relative advantage; the game is played by capturing territory and often margins are so slim that to an inexperienced eye it can be unclear who's winning or losing. Meanwhile, chess is completely decisive: the loser literally cannot move the king anymore and is forced to surrender. The analogy is that Chinese favor long prolonged campaigns with lots of subtle things (like Chinese banquets), while Western civilization favors a single glorious battle with a decisive outcome (like in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) [2].

I actually don't have much experience with Go. The game is totally badass, but it seems like it's hard to find anyone who plays it these days that isn't either: (a) someone who watches <em>Hikaru No Go</em> and loves it, doesn't know a thing about actual strategy [3] or (b) grand-master status, travelling to Japan and China, sleeping in parks, playing world-class experts and beating them, nbd.

Re: Chess, I used to play club. Our team was actually halfway decent, but we tended to lose nearly all of our matches to the other all-the-way decent teams. A lot of the way this worked was because many of the other schools we played has exactly one ridiculously good player. In a 7-on-7 chess match, this turns out to be a formidable advantage. Not only does it mean that your board #2 (who would otherwise be first board) gets to play a slightly worse player, but also the advantage cascades down to your last player. Of course, on our team (minus my freshman year) we tended to just lose because we never had that big money cash cow board #1 player.

Well my senior year, we <em>still</em> didn't have a good enough board #1, so I went to our local middle school and recruited one of the 8th graders there to play as our board #1. This kid was balls good, but he looked so little at the time that no one thought much of him. Before each match, I'd be up front with the other team and let them know we were playing an 8th grader as first board: I'd explain that there wasn't nothing in the rule book saying that we couldn't do this but if they felt uncomfortable with it we'd be fine disqualifying him. The captain from the other team would usually be happy to play him, at which point the 8th grader would typically beat him handily. Seriously, in 8th grade he was already one of the best players in the league by a long shot. Some guys are just that good.

No real take-away from this post. I will say that both Go and Chess are damn good games and you should play both of them if you get the chance.

[1] Okay, I'll admit it, The worst part about driving is having to listen to the same Top 40 songs all of the time on Wild 94.9 and Movin' 99.7. Yes, I do occasionally groove out to the music, but the effect wears off pretty quickly by the time I'm hearing "Teenage Dream" for the fifth time in the past hour. I've also noticed that different radio stations often seem to be playing the exact same song (or commercial) at the same time. I will admit that it is pretty smart to force the listener to tune in for a commercial break, but it is most definitely very annoying as a user trying to channel surf the radio. I personally suspect that the radio (or the lack thereof) has a lot to do with the fact that the American people hate commuting so much and consistently rank it as one of the top causes for job dissatisfaction.

Well I started listening to audio CD's earlier this year and will say that they've <em>solved everything</em>. I'll even go so far as to say that they've made driving the car somewhat enjoyable. I can learn about cows in <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma </em>or listen to huge fiction works like <em>The Fountainhead</em> (by the way, that book is freaking long to the point that I actually got a copy of it on book on Kindle and read through that as a companion to my car ride). Basically, I just go to the library and check out the first audio CD with a title that I've heard of.

I've also been hearing a lot of good things about podcasts, but I've been unsuccessful at making them work with Linux and having to do anything on Windows is not something I'm willing to compromise (personal flaw). Let me know if you do the podcast thing and if that works out for you!

[2] You either defeat the evil vegan boyfriend, or you don't. nbd.

[3] Not that watching anime isn't a good way to learn something! I know plenty of people who got into tennis from watching that tennis anime <em>Prince of Tennis</em>. Yeah, if you start playing tennis you too can do this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBqBCMpn4ZE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBqBCMpn4ZE</a>
